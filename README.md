# Imperial College London Materials Science First Year Coding Project 

Team memebers: Natalie Wu, Younes Moustiri, Vinuk Welikala, Inkrat Surachescomson

First Year computing challenge which aimed to model the kinetics of polymerisation and use it to simulate a real
experiment with the goal to see how different reactions and their parameters (the kinetic constants
of the reactions involved) affect the final chain-length distribution in the system.
